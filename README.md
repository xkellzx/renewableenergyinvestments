Rice Datathon 2023 - Chevron Track

Description
Chevron is continuously looking for renewable energy businesses, initiatives, and start-ups to potentially invest in as part of their energy transition strategy. With each year, this task of narrowing down prospective collaborators becomes trickier and more difficult as the national investment in clean energy explodes throughout the United States. With the idea that the greater the investment in a state, the more likely Chevron is to find collaborators and companies of interest within that state, Chevron will narrow down the list of states to look for potential investments within using predictions for the amount of renewable energy investment dollars each state will be given.
Objective

Provided that it is the year 2019, Chevron is planning for the next year and needs to know which US states seem most promising with regards to renewable investments. In this Data Science Challenge, you are tasked with developing a model to predict:
The Renewable Energy Investments ($) of each US state for 2020.
